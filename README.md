One of the most common diseases in the world, diabetes is becoming more and more common among sufferers. Although the exact etiology of diabetes is still unknown, researchers think that environmental lifestyle factors and genetics both contribute significantly to the disease. Diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar levels and impaired insulin production or utilization. It affects millions of people worldwide, leading to various complications such as cardiovascular diseases, kidney problems, and nerve damage. 
A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis and building a classification Model.
The overconcept opf this project is to load the dataset, learn about the dataset, visualize and train the model.
The first step is to load the python libraries and dataset in jupyter notebook. i loaded pandas, seaborn, matplotlib libraries first and then loaded the dataset.
The next step is to understand the dataset. To understand the dataset i uses various function like .describe(), .dtypes(), .head() , .shape() and more.
After i have basic understanding of the dataset next step for me is to Visualize. For visualization i use pairplot, boxblot, correlation matrix and distribution plot.
After visualization of the dataset, the next step for me is to model training for that i split the dataset into train and test.
I uses two Model Logistic Regression Model and Random Forest Model for train and testing the dataset.
I used these two model to find Accuracy, True Positives and True Negatives values.
Based on these three and overall accuricy from my point of view Logistic Regression Model is better then Random Forest Model.
